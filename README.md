## 🌐 Project Description
**M104 Student Voting Platform** is a web application designed for first-year students in the **Digital Development** track at the **Institut Spécialisé de Technologie Appliquée (ISTA-NTIC)**.  
It was implemented as part of the course **M104 – Développer des sites web statiques**.  

The platform allows students to upload and showcase their HTML projects, then vote for the best one.  
The main goals are to **enhance competitiveness, productivity, and creativity** among students while providing an interactive learning experience.  
Students can navigate through all submitted pages and cast a single vote for the project they find most creative.  
The system automatically counts votes and displays the top-ranked projects in real time.
